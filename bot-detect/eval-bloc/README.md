# Introduction

This repo contains the code to evaluate [BLOC](https://github.com/anwala/bloc).

Check out the `workflow` folder for the scripts.

I use [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to organize the workflow.
See the `Snakefile` for details.

To run this workflow in your local environment, copy the raw tweets data `/path/to/evaluation/tweets/dataset` to a local directory and change the paths in `Snakefile`.
