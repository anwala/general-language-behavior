This Folder contains base classes for each problem.
In subfolder "lv" are implementations for these problems. So the class hierarchy is:

LCX: parent class for all longest common X problems
- LCS: longest common substring
    - LCS_last_visited
    - LCS_last_visited_int
- LCR: longest common repeat
    - LCR_last_visited
    - LCR_last_visited_int
  - GLCR: generalized longest common repeat
      - GLCR_last_visited_int
