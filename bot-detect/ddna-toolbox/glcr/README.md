# DDNA Longest Common Subsequence Calculator

This project is a submdule of the Digital DNA repository. It consists in a Python wrapper of an high efficient C++ implementation of the Longest Common Substring algorithm.

# Requirements

The Python building is done through distutils, but, since the C++ part needs to be compiled you must have a C/C++ compiler installed.

- python 3.6 or greater
- `numpy` python package

You can simply clone the repository and then run:
